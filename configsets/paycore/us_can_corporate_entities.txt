# E.g. "work market inc" will tokenize to
# [work, market, market_inc]
# and not match "fisher price inc"
# (though it will match "boston market inc")

# Those terms will just be contained within shingles like the rest
# of the less-specific terms above
# (TODO:  Regex to specifically match only email addresses, and replace with
# the left-of-the-@ value)... for use in company analysis (AND email analysis)

# But these shingles will be specifically removed in the stopwording step
